["Dont judge a person by the clothes he wears","He sits no sure that sits too high","He that respects not is not respected","One can not be in two places at once","No weal without woe","Little chips light great fires","An apple a day keeps the doctor away","Poverty is stranger to industry","Deliberate in counsel， prompt in action","So said， so done","Love me,love my dog","Seeing is believing","A slow sparrow should make an early start","not pleased by external gains,not saddened by personnal losses","spare no effort; go all out; do one\u0027s best ","bid farewell to the old and usher in the new; ring out the old year and ring in the new"]
